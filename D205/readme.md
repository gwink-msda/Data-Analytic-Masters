This class requires a lot more guidance.  It's like the wild west of PAs.  Also, how is it possible that you send emails to an org box for D205, monitored by all the D205 instructors, and they just don't respond.  That's crazy.

Anyways, the first day assigned to this class was pretty much getting my footing by looking at the training they wanted me to accomplish on DataCamp.  It was a cool refreshed but I don't see myself sitting through the 30 hrs of training when I can identify what is needed based on the performance objectives.

So without further ado, I will list out each section of the PA and answer them as I go.

A.  Summarize a research question that can be answered using both the original database and the add-on CSV data. The question should require data from both these data sources.
    
   1. Identify which data from the original data set and the add-on CSV file are needed to answer the research question.
